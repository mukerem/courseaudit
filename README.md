# Course Audit
This project is a Course Audit for ASTU CSE 2022 department GC students.

## Project Description
The main aim of this project is to help ASTU CSE 2022 department students \
to know their total credit hour. 

Sometimes I forgot to check, if can I graduate or not. \
One best feature of this system is that it tells in which semester we missed a course.

This is a well tested and functioning project among our peers.

### Technology Used
* Django 2.0 - as a skeleton for the project.
* Python 3
* HTML - for template skeleton and presentation of data.
* CSS - for template beauty.
* sqlite - for database.

### Steps to follow
* User must choose department elective courses, free elective courses and after all hit the "Audit" button.
